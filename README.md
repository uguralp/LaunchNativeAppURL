# LaunchNativeAppURL

This sample project contains:

1. Custom View for making a Controller like UIPageViewController (using XIB to create the Custom View).
2. "Launching an app" feature using the URL link. It redirects you to the app if you have it.
3. A simple example for creating a TableView programmatically and hiding/unhiding it.
4. A simple example for transferring to the data from one to another ViewController.
